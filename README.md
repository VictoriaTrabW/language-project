# Using Huggingface to determine emotions in headlines about women around the world
This is my self-assigned project, which can be seen as a continuation of assignment 4, in that the methods are similar, but the dataset is different, which makes room for exploring other aspects of using Huggingface for classifying emotions.

## Dependencies and data
The project has been run through UCloud in the Coder Python app (1.78.2), and the neccesary programs are listed in requirements.txt.

The data has been obtained from Kaggle.com at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/women-in-headlines-bias?select=headlines.csv
The dataset was created by Amber Thomas and contains headlines where women are mentioned in articles from different countries from 2012-2021. The dataset has been downloaded and is in the in folder. I will only be using a subset of the data.
