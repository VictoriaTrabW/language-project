## Dependencies and data
The project has been run through UCloud in the Coder Python app (1.78.2), and the neccesary programs are listed in requirements.txt.

The dataset has been obtained from kaggle.com at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrlucasfischer/bertembedded-spam-messages
This dataset takes departure in another dataset, but has BERT-embeddings included, which saves prepocessing time, which is valuable when UCloud is not always available. This is the original dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset?resource=download
I have downloaded the dataset and uploaded it to my member file folder on UCloud called “spam_encoded.csv”.
